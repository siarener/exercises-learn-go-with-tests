# Exercises: Learn Go with Tests

This is me going through [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) by Chris James.

There are minor differences. 
When working on [app](./app/) I changed the structure quite a bit, as I tried out dividing the code into different packages to separate the concerns. Additionally, I put the integration tests into their own package to ensure that they are only using public functions.
